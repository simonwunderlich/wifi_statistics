DESCRIPTION
===========

This Linux kernel module tracks stations on a 802.11 monitor interface
and collects various statistics. This might be useful to assess link qualities,
find out which stations are in range or are interfering, etc.

BUILD
=====

To compile against your currently installed  kernel, just type:

# make

if you want to compile against some other kernel, use:

# make KERNELPATH=/path/to/kernel

USAGE
=====
Usage:

1. Create monitor device mon0, for example by doing:
	iw phy phy0 interface add mon0 type monitor flags control fcsfail
	ifconfig mon0 up

2. insert the kernel module:
	insmod wifi-statistics.ko

3. activate the monitor device:
	echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/wifi_statistics/mon0/activate

4. read the statistics:
	 cat /sys/kernel/debug/wifi_statistics/mon0/stats

Optional:

echo "read" > /sys/kernel/debug/wifi_statistics/mon0/mode
or
echo "reset" > /sys/kernel/debug/wifi_statistics/mon0/mode

The reset mode is similar to the read mode, deletes all
stations from the internal database when reading.
In read mode, the internal database is not modified.
(reset mode is default)
